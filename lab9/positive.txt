I had an amazing stay at this hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way
to make our stay comfortable. The room was clean and spacious, and the view from the balcony was breathtaking.
The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area.
